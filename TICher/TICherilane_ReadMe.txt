The goal: Cherilane is intended as a mildly adult "romantic-encounters" style NPC for BG1:RE. She is a bard, formerly employed as a poetry and music instructor for <CHARNAME>, who appears in up to six short encounters; Candlekeep Storeroom, Candlekeep Inn, Nashkel Fair, Nashkel Fair's Black Lotus Tent, Daveorn's Quarters in Cloakwood Mines, and the Second Floor of the Duchal Palace. Cherilane has been in love with <CHARNAME> since he/she came of age, having been one of his/her instructors for years. Cherilane will romance male or female player characters, although some content varies based on the player character's gender.

The reality: Cherilane is an alpha. The encounters work more or less as intended, although I'd like to add a little more "back-story" content to the different episodes. Cherilane is not yet programmed to allow different levels of "descriptive text," and that should not be difficult since she has few "adult" lines and a lot of content for players who prefer teen-style content.
